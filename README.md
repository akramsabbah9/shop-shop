# Shop-Shop

## Description

Shop-Shop is a MERN full-stack e-commerce application that allows users to make purchases from its selection of goods. Users can visit the website and sort items by category, then add them to their cart. They can then checkout these items using stripe. Shop-Shop uses reducers to keep track of its global state, avoiding the prop drilling endemic to basic React.
